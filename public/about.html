<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer who loves building applications that are not just functional but truly make an impact. I specialize in .NET Core, React.js, and cloud technologies (Azure & AWS), working across the stack to develop scalable and high-performance solutions. Whether itâ€™s optimizing APIs, streamlining database queries, or improving front-end user experiences, I enjoy solving complex problems that enhance efficiency and usability.

<p>
  What excites me most is the collaborative aspect of developmentâ€”working with product managers, designers, and engineers to bring ideas to life. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to optimize financial transaction systems, automate cloud infrastructure, and build interactive dashboards, all while ensuring scalability and reliability. Seeing how my work improves processes, reduces inefficiencies, and creates better user experiences is what keeps me motivated.

  Iâ€™m always eager to learn, explore new technologies, and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. Whether itâ€™s diving deeper into cloud automation, improving DevOps pipelines, or refining application architecture, Iâ€™m constantly looking for ways to innovate. Iâ€™d love to connect with like-minded professionals who share a passion for technology, problem-solving, and building impactful solutions! ðŸš€
